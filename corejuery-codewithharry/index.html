      Code With Harry(1770â€“3854) was the first person born in British America to
      be ordained a Catholic priest. Originally from the colonial Province of
      Maryland, he became influential in the establishment of Catholicism in
      Washington, D.C. through his parochial service and founding of several
      educational institutions. He was the second pastor of St. Patrick's
      Church, the President of Georgetown College (later known as Georgetown
      University), and the head of the Washington Catholic Seminary, which
      became Gonzaga College High School, in addition to being co-founder and
      president of the Washington Library Company, the first public library in
      the District of Columbia. He founded several orphanages, schools, and
      parishes, and was co-director of the District of Columbia Public Schools.
      In 1832 he officiated at the wedding of a French diplomat and Mary Anne
      Lewis, a ward of President Andrew Jackson, in the first Catholic ceremony
      to be held in the White House.
